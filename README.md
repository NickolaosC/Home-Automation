## Communication
### Protocols (communication method or medium)
It is the mode (means) of communication, traditionally this might have been equated to a phone call, text, in-person, etc. In Networking terms ???
#### Wireless
- 345 Mhz / 433 Mhz
- Lutron
- Bluetooth (2.4 Ghz)
- WiFi (2.4 Ghz, 5 Ghz, 6 Ghz Networks)
- Zigbee (2.4 Ghz, 868 Mhz or 915 Mhz) -- Mesh Protocol
- Z-Wave (ZWave) -- Mesh Protocol
- Thread
Specifically, it's a low-power, IPv6-based mesh networking protocol designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Thread provides a reliable and secure way for smart home devices to communicate with each other and with the internet. Â  
It's often used in conjunction with the Matter standard, which aims to unify smart home device communication across different brands and platforms.
#### Wired
- ABus
- X10
- Ethernet (Networks)
-- IPv4 IPv6

### Standards
Often compared to the language being spoken. In Networking terms ???
- Matter
It aims to create a common language for these devices, allowing them to communicate and interoperate seamlessly regardless of the manufacturer or platform they belong to.  It most commonly uses the Thread and WiFi protocols, however other protoocols such as Ethernet, Zigbee, ZWave, Bluetooth could all one day support Matter.  While Zigbee was initially considered as a potential underlying technology for Matter, it faced challenges in terms of security, scalability, and interoperability. As a result, the Matter Alliance decided to focus on Thread and Wi-Fi as the primary communication protocols. This does not discount the possibility that Zigbee-based devices may be integrated into the Matter ecosystem in the future, especially if significant improvements are made to address the aforementioned challenges.
